UI Plan for Zero Trading Bot Platform
1. High‑Level Information Architecture (IA)

Navigation Structure: The app will use a persistent sidebar for primary navigation, providing quick access to all core sections. This sidebar will house main items like Bots and Account (with future scalability for multiple wallets or market types). The layout is designed for a single-user on a local machine, but it follows a professional multi-section structure similar to institutional platforms. The Bots list is the landing view for daily ops. Key sections include:

Account Dashboard: A top-level overview of the user’s trading account and wallet. This page shows total equity, performance summaries, and allocations. It’s a secondary view for monitoring overall portfolio health. In future, if multiple wallets or account scopes are supported, a dropdown selector at the top of the dashboard can switch contexts (ensuring the IA can accommodate multi-account without confusion). This dashboard acts as a portfolio-level summary, aggregating data from all bots.

Bots: This section includes both the Bot List and individual Bot Detail views:

Bot List: A table listing all bots with key info – name/market, current status (running/paused/stopped/error), risk state (normal or if any limits hit), last update time, and quick action buttons (start/stop). Each row lets the operator see at a glance which bots need attention. A global New Bot button (or “Create Bot”) is prominent here to launch the bot builder workflow.

Bot Detail: A dedicated page per bot, reached by selecting a bot from the list. This is a comprehensive dashboard for that bot’s performance and controls. It contains charts (P&L, inventory, price with grid overlay), detailed orders/fills, and a timeline of events. Navigation breadcrumbs or tabs allow switching between different bots’ detail pages easily (possibly via the sidebar or a bot submenu for quick jumps).

Bot Builder (Create Bot): An interface for configuring a new trading bot. This could be a separate page or a modal wizard launched from the Bot List. It guides the user through selecting the market (Solana trading pair), setting strategy parameters (range low/high, grid count, order size, recenter rules, risk limits, schedule), and confirming deployment. A multi-step form is recommended for clarity (e.g. Market & Range → Risk Limits → Schedule → Review). The user can review all settings before finalizing. This builder emphasizes simplicity and guidance so the operator doesn’t get lost in options.

(Optional) Settings/Connections: Though the platform is self-hosted, an advanced user might need a settings page for things like API connections status or service health. No wallet/key management appears in the UI for now (keys remain in bot-runner only). A minimalist settings page can list the 4 services’ status (UI, API, market data feed, bot-runner) with health indicators, since all components run locally.

Sidebar & Layout: The left sidebar provides a clear mental model of the app’s scope. Icons and labels for each main section improve scan-ability. For example, a Dashboard icon (overview), a Bots icon (maybe a grid or robot symbol), and Account (portfolio icon). The sidebar also houses light/dark mode toggle and a collapsible profile section (showing user or system info). This approach mirrors pro trading tools (like Bitsgap’s unified interface or TradersPost’s sidebar) that let users seamlessly move between portfolio view and bot management. The content area (right of sidebar) uses a standard header for context (e.g. page title, maybe quick global controls like “Pause All Bots” if needed). Overall, the IA ensures that at any time, the user knows where they are (via highlighted sidebar item and page titles) and can quickly jump to critical sections.

2. UI Patterns & Components

Design patterns will prioritize clarity and immediate comprehension, since one wrong click or missed status could mean real losses. The following UI components and patterns will be used consistently:

Data Tables: Tables are central for the bot list, open orders, fill history, etc. We will implement sleek, responsive tables using Tailwind + shadcn’s table components. Tables will have sortable column headers and fixed headers on scroll. Key numeric columns (prices, PnL, etc.) use monospaced fonts for readability and alignment. For example, the Bot List table shows each bot in a row with columns for Status, Market, PnL, etc., enabling scanning across bots. Use subtle row striping or dividers to separate rows without heavy gridlines (for a clean, pro look). Where data is updating in real-time (e.g. last price or PnL), the cell will momentarily highlight (e.g. flash light green for uptick or red for downtick) to draw attention. Tooltips on header labels provide definitions (important for a professional feel). Pagination or virtual scrolling will handle longer tables, though initially the single-user is likely to run a handful of bots.

Status Chips & Badges: Small, colored label “chips” will indicate various statuses in a concise way. For example, each bot’s status: Running (green pill), Paused (gray/amber pill), Stopped (gray pill), Error (red pill). Risk states will also be shown as chips or icons: e.g. a shield or warning icon with “Risk Limit Hit” in red for a bot that auto-stopped on a risk trigger. These badges appear in tables and headers (for instance, in the Bot Detail header next to the bot name, you might see a green “Running” chip or a red “Stopped – Risk Triggered” badge). This pattern follows the approach of many ops dashboards, making statuses obvious at a glance. The chips use high-contrast text (dark text on light-colored chip for light theme) and subtle icons when appropriate (a play icon for running, pause for paused, etc.) to reinforce meaning.

Health Banners & Notifications: To handle global system status and critical alerts, we use banner components at the top of the content area. For example, if the market-data service disconnects or lags, a top banner (yellow/orange) might say “⚠️ Market data connection lost, attempting reconnection” so the user is immediately aware. Similarly, if the bot-runner service stops or if any bot hits a critical error, a prominent red banner could appear: “🛑 Bot XYZ stopped due to risk limit – review in Bot Detail.” These banners remain sticky until resolved or dismissed by the user, ensuring important issues aren’t missed. They provide an optional action on the right side (e.g. a “Retry Connection” button if applicable, or “View Details” to jump to the problem bot). This is akin to how professional monitoring UIs surface critical incidents in a non-intrusive yet visible way. Once acknowledged, the banner can fade out. Additionally, less critical confirmations (like “Bot created successfully”) will appear as temporary toast notifications at the bottom or top right, using shadcn’s toast component.

Command Modals & Confirmations: Starting, stopping, or pausing a bot are impactful actions, so the UI will confirm or inform appropriately. Quick actions like Start/Stop on the bot list can be one-click for speed (especially Start or Pause). Stopping a bot (which might cancel orders and potentially realize losses) will prompt a confirmation dialog: “Are you sure you want to stop Bot XYZ? All outstanding orders will be cancelled.” using a modal with Cancel/Confirm. This balances safety with speed – e.g. a running bot’s Stop button triggers a modal (to prevent accidental shutdown), whereas Pause might not if it’s not destructive. The confirmation modals use clear language and highlight consequences (maybe list current held assets or PnL impact if relevant), reinforcing a professional “operator” workflow where each command is deliberate. After confirmation, a toast “Bot XYZ stopped” can confirm the action’s success. Similarly, deleting a bot or adjusting settings gets a confirmation modal. Non-critical actions (like toggling light/dark mode or acknowledging a risk event) can use simpler confirmations or none at all, focusing user attention only when needed.

Risk & Alert Indicators: Given the emphasis on risk management, the UI will incorporate clear risk state indicators. Each bot will have an internal Risk Status that can be Normal, Warning, or Halted. This could be shown as a small colored dot or icon next to the bot name (green, orange, red) in lists and detail headers. When a risk threshold is breached (e.g. max drawdown), the bot’s status chip changes to an Error/Stopped state, and an entry is logged in the Risk Events timeline (see Bot Detail). The risk events timeline itself is a UI pattern: displayed as a vertical list of timestamped entries, each with an icon (🟡 for warnings, 🔴 for critical) and short description (“11:45:30 – Drawdown exceeded 20%, bot auto-paused”). This timeline may appear on the Bot Detail page, perhaps in a side panel or below charts. It gives operators a chronological view of significant events and risk triggers. By keeping this separate from raw log output, we highlight only the important anomalies. The design ensures these alerts stand out but don’t overwhelm – e.g., use accent colors and perhaps subtle animation (like a brief pulse on the sidebar bot icon or a badge count) when a new risk event occurs, prompting the user to check the timeline. This approach aligns with robust risk management frameworks in pro trading tools, making sure the UI actively assists in risk supervision rather than just displaying data.

Forms and Inputs: The bot configuration inputs (market selectors, numeric fields for ranges, etc.) will use clear labels and inline help. Patterns like segmented controls or sliders can make setting a grid count or selecting “Recenter: Off / Auto” more intuitive. We’ll use consistent form styling from shadcn (e.g. using their <Input>, <Select>, and form validation states). For schedule windows, an interactive sub-component (like a week schedule grid with selectable time blocks, or simpler start/end time pickers) will be used to avoid confusion. All forms will provide immediate validation feedback (e.g. if range low >= range high, highlight fields in red with a message) to prevent configuration errors before running the bot. Command forms (like a manual order in advanced use) would similarly use concise design with perhaps a confirmation summary before execution.

Overall, these UI patterns aim for an “operational clarity” – everything important is labeled and color-coded, and the interface remains uncluttered and familiar even under real-time updates. By following known patterns (badges for status, modals for confirms, toasts for feedback), a senior engineer can implement these quickly with the Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn stack.

3. Charts Layout & Analytics Views

Charts are central to providing the “premium, institutional dashboard” feel. We will leverage TradingView Lightweight Charts for primary time-series data (for their professional look and interactive panning/zooming) and Recharts for simpler analytical visuals. Each core view integrates the appropriate charts with overlays, legends, and callouts as needed:

Bot Detail Page – Performance & Market Charts: This page will have a flexible dashboard layout to show multiple charts at once for the selected bot:

Price Chart with Grid Overlay (main chart): A line chart (via TradingView) displaying the market price over time for the bot’s trading pair (no OHLC for MVP). Overlaid on this chart are horizontal lines representing the bot’s grid levels (range bands). For example, if the bot sets buy/sell orders at certain intervals between range low and high, each level is drawn as a dashed line across the chart. The current price is highlighted (perhaps a bold line or marker) so the user sees where the price is relative to the grid. When orders execute, we can plot markers on the chart (e.g. a green up-arrow on buys, red down-arrow on sells) at the price and time they occurred. A legend or caption identifies these overlays (e.g. a legend showing “Grid Levels” with a colored line sample, “Executed Buy” with a green arrow icon). The chart supports tooltips on hover to show precise price/time and possibly which grid level it is. This visual immediately communicates how the strategy is performing in the market context. For instance, an operator can see the price oscillating within the bands and which orders are getting filled. Callouts: We can add annotations for notable events – e.g., if the range was recentered, a label “Recentered to new range” might appear at that point on the chart. Similarly, if a risk auto-stop happened, a callout or vertical line could mark “Bot Stopped” at the specific time. These callouts ensure the chart isn’t just raw data but tells a story of the bot’s operations.

Equity & PnL Chart: This chart shows the bot’s performance over time – essentially the bot’s equity curve. It plots the total value of the bot’s holdings (in base currency or USD) as a line over time. Optionally, we might depict PnL (profit and loss) in the same chart or a secondary y-axis. For clarity, one approach is a dual-line chart: one line for cumulative PnL (or % gain) and one for current equity. Alternatively, a single area chart could represent equity, and we use shading to indicate above/below starting equity (area in green when above initial capital, red when below). A baseline at the starting capital helps show gains/losses intuitively. The chart might update every few seconds via SSE, reflecting real-time unrealized PnL changes. A small legend denotes each metric (e.g. “Equity (USD)” and “PnL (USD)” with corresponding colors). This chart helps the operator quickly gauge how profitable the bot is and detect any drawdowns. We will also integrate markers for drawdown: for example, the worst drawdown can be highlighted (maybe a red dot on the equity line where it dipped most from a peak, with a tooltip “Max Drawdown -15%”). If the user set a risk limit (say 20% drawdown), an horizontal line or band can indicate that threshold, visually connecting to any risk trigger event. This invites the user to correlate performance with risk events.

Inventory Over Time Chart: A unique insight for a grid/range bot is how its asset holdings shift. We’ll show a chart with time on the x-axis and asset quantities on the y-axis. This could be a dual-line chart: one line for amount of base asset (e.g. SOL) held by the bot, another for quote asset (e.g. USDC) held. As the bot trades, these lines move inversely (selling base for quote will decrease the base line and increase the quote line). Using two y-axes (one on left for base, right for quote) or plotting both on a normalized scale can work; however, a simpler method is a stacked area chart showing the total value held in each asset. For example, area in one color = value in SOL, another color = value in USDC, stacked to show total (which should align with the equity chart). This immediately shows if the bot is holding more of one asset over time – e.g. as price rises, the bot might end up holding more USDC (having sold some SOL). A legend identifies each asset’s color. This chart is more about strategy diagnostics: it answers “Am I accumulating base asset or quote asset as time goes on?”. It helps in tuning the grid strategy (e.g. if the user always ends up with too much of one asset, they might adjust parameters). Since this is a secondary analytic chart, we’d likely use Recharts for simplicity. It will update in real-time with each fill or price change that affects inventory. Overlay & callouts: if the bot rebalances or recenters (which might reset inventory), we mark that on the chart (e.g. a vertical line with note “Recentered – inventory reset”). Legends and tooltip on hover (showing exact amounts at time) are included for precision.

Orders & Fills Tables: Below the charts, the Bot Detail will present detailed tables for Open Orders and Trade Fills. These might be in tabs or side-by-side if space permits. The Open Orders table lists all active limit orders the bot has placed (price, size, side buy/sell, status), which complements the price chart’s visual lines. The Fills/Trade History table logs each executed order with time, price, size, and resulting PnL or inventory change. These tables are updated live (via SSE events) so the operator can monitor the bot’s activity in textual form alongside the charts. If space allows, we could show a compact timeline view for Risk Events next to these tables (especially if using a 2-column layout: charts on top, then bottom left tables, bottom right risk timeline). The Risk Events timeline (as described in Patterns) lists events like “Stop loss triggered” or “Order failed” with timestamps – essentially a filtered log for this bot. This timeline uses an easy-to-scan format (maybe an icon and one-line description for each event). By placing it near the fills table, the user can correlate an event (e.g. “stop triggered at 10:00”) with what trades happened at that time.

Layout Considerations: The Bot Detail page should feel like a cockpit, with the main chart (price) taking prominence (perhaps a wide panel across top half), and the secondary charts (equity, inventory) either positioned below it or in smaller side panels. A possible layout is a two-column grid: left side 2/3 width for the tall price chart, right side 1/3 width stacked with two smaller charts (equity and inventory). Then a full-width section below for orders/fills and events. On larger monitors, users might open multiple browser windows (one per bot) for side-by-side monitoring, so each detail page should stand on its own with clear titles and context.

Account Dashboard – Portfolio Analytics: The account dashboard offers a more aggregate view of performance across all bots (and overall wallet holdings):

Total Equity Curve & Drawdown: A time-series chart (using TradingView for consistency) showing the total value of the user’s trading wallet over time. This effectively sums all bot equities (or can even include any idle funds). Alongside this, the drawdown over time can be visualized – e.g. we can have a secondary area under the equity line showing drawdown % from the last peak. Alternatively, two charts: one for equity, and directly below it a smaller chart for drawdown percentage. Since this is more analytical, we might choose a clear line chart with perhaps a background shade highlighting periods of drawdown. Key metrics like Current NAV, YTD Return, Max Drawdown can be displayed as numeric callouts above the chart for quick reading. The chart should allow zooming into different time ranges (1D, 1W, 1M, All) since the platform will accumulate data over long periods.

Allocation Breakdown: A snapshot of how the capital is distributed. This can be a donut or pie chart (with Recharts) showing allocation by bot or by asset. For instance, if the user runs multiple bots, one segment per bot (with segment size = capital allocated or currently in that bot). Alternatively, by asset: e.g. X% in SOL, Y% in USDC across all strategies. We might actually show both via tabs or side-by-side if space: one pie for allocation by strategy, one for allocation by asset class. This gives an institutional feel of portfolio management. Each segment is labeled or has a legend listing bot name or asset and percentage. For readability, we’ll likely use a limited color palette (each segment a distinct color, matching maybe the bot’s designated color if we assign one, or asset colors if common like gold for SOL? but likely custom colors to fit theme). This chart is not time-series; it reflects the latest state, but we can allow toggling to see an earlier date’s breakdown (though MVP likely just current snapshot).

Fees & Performance Over Time: Another analytical chart to emphasize operational efficiency. Using Recharts, we can implement a bar or line chart for Fees Paid over time. For example, a monthly or weekly bar chart showing total trading fees incurred by all bots (or split by bot if needed). Alternatively, a cumulative line of fees. This helps the user understand overhead costs. Additionally, we might show P&L breakdown over time (maybe a stacked bar per day showing profit or loss contributed by each bot). This kind of chart could be part of a “secondary breakdown” section using Recharts, as it’s not the primary focus but adds depth to analytics.

Key Metrics and Health: At the top of the Dashboard, we’ll present key summary metrics in a card grid. For example: Total Balance, 24h P&L, Active Bots Count, Winning Trades %, etc. Each metric in a small card with an icon and value. If any service or connection issues exist (e.g. market data down), a small indicator might show here as well (like a connectivity icon red if something is wrong, doubling as a link to system status). These at-a-glance stats complement the charts and reinforce the “control center” vibe.

Layout: The account dashboard likely uses a multi-column layout: top row with summary metric cards, main row with the big equity chart (taking maybe 2/3 width) and on the side the allocation pie (1/3 width). Below could be a full-width or split section for other charts like fees or a table of bot rankings. The visual balance should say “comprehensive but clean” – plenty of data, but organized. We avoid a dark, gaming-like style; instead, a light background with well-defined panels for each chart (light mode by default with good contrast and gridlines on charts clearly visible). All charts will include titles, axes labels, and legends where needed to be self-explanatory – an expectation in institutional analytics.

Real-Time Updates & Legends: All time-series charts will update via SSE in near-real-time. To handle slightly out-of-order events, charts will plot points according to their timestamp – if a late update arrives, the library will insert it in the correct time spot (the TradingView library can handle upserts of bars by time). The UI will animate transitions smoothly so that jumps in data are visually tracked (no jarring redraws). Legends next to each chart use matching colors for lines/areas and are updated with the latest values (e.g. a legend might also display the last value or current PnL). Interactive legends (hover to highlight a series) can be enabled for advanced users. Every chart is also equipped with a fullscreen/expand option if the user needs a closer look (leveraging TradingView’s capabilities, or simply rendering it larger in a modal). By carefully designing chart overlays and legends, we ensure the user can interpret complex data quickly. For example, if a user sees a red line in a chart, a legend reading “Drawdown (%)” in red clarifies it. If they see a horizontal band on the price chart, the legend says “Grid range”. This way, even a first-time user of the platform can orient themselves with minimal guesswork.

In summary, each view’s charts are tailored: Bot Detail focuses on that bot’s market and performance specifics, while the Account Dashboard aggregates at a portfolio level. The use of professional chart libraries and careful layering of information (with overlays and callouts) will give a true institutional feel where data is rich but accessible.

4. Interaction Flows & User Workflows

We outline key user workflows to ensure the UI supports practical operation of the trading bots efficiently and safely:

Creating a New Bot (Configuration Workflow): The user initiates this via a prominent “New Bot” button (e.g., in the Bots List header). This opens the Bot Builder, which is a guided form. The flow is as follows:

Select Market: User chooses the trading pair/market (e.g. SOL/USDC). This might be a searchable dropdown with market symbols and names. Once selected, the UI can display current price and perhaps a mini-chart for recent price action in that pair – giving context while setting range.

Set Range & Grid Parameters: The user inputs Range Low and Range High prices between which the bot will operate. A helpful UI element here is to show the difference or % width of the range, and ensure Low < High (with validation). They then choose Grid Count (number of levels) – possibly via a slider or stepper input. As they adjust, the UI could show a preview count of how much price gap between each grid level. Order Size is specified (in base or quote units); we’ll label clearly which unit. If the user has connected wallet balances, the form can hint how much they have available and how much will be used approximately (e.g. “This strategy will place X orders of Y SOL each, requiring ~Z SOL and ~U USDC”).

Recenter & Strategy Options: The user selects what happens if the market leaves the range. For MVP, maybe simple choices: No Recenter (stop bot) vs Auto-Recenter to new price. This could be a radio button or toggle. Additional strategy toggles might include “Post Only orders” or “Allow Partial Fills”, etc., if relevant. Keep these options organized under an Advanced section if they are numerous, to avoid scaring basic users.

Risk Limits: Here the user sets protective limits. Inputs such as Max Drawdown % or Max Single Trade Loss, Stop Loss Price (if any), etc. These fields are optional but recommended; we can visually emphasize risk (maybe an icon or colored section) to signal their importance. For each, a brief description or tooltip explains the safeguard (e.g. “Bot will auto-stop if equity drops 20% from peak”).

Schedule (Active Time Windows): If the user wants the bot only running at certain times, they configure it here. The UI might present days of the week with toggles and time-range selectors. For example, a grid where each weekday has a checkbox and time range input (Start and End time). The user could set “Active Mon-Fri 09:00-16:00” for a bot that only runs in certain hours (useful in FX or stock contexts, but maybe for crypto, 24/7 is common – still, we allow it for flexibility). Another approach is a Cron-like textual input for advanced users, but that’s not user-friendly. We prefer a visual scheduler. If no schedule is set, default is 24/7. The UI should clearly indicate if a bot will start immediately or wait for the next window (e.g. if you set a future schedule). Perhaps a summary line like “Bot will run: Weekdays 09:00-16:00 (pauses outside this window)” appears once configured.

Review & Launch: The final step collates all chosen settings into a summary view. This summary is formatted clearly, e.g.:

Market: SOL/USDC

Range: 20.00 – 30.00 USDC (current price 25.00)

Grid Levels: 10 (approx 1 USDC spacing)

Order Size: 5 SOL per order (~$125 each)

Recenter: On (auto-adjust if out of range)

Risk Limits: Stop at 20% drawdown

Schedule: Weekdays, 09:00-16:00.

The user confirms with a “Launch Bot” button. A confirmation modal might appear if something seems off (e.g. “Launch with these settings?”) just to double-confirm, or if immediate start will place orders now. After launching, the user is taken either to the Bot Detail page for the new bot (to monitor it live) or back to the list with a success message. Real-time feedback confirms the bot creation (and the backend starts placing grid orders). This flow emphasizes ease-of-use and correctness, guiding the user step by step so even non-experts feel comfortable configuring an “institutional” strategy.

Starting/Stopping/Pausing Bots: From the Bot List, each bot has controls for these actions. A running bot might show a Pause or Stop icon; a stopped bot shows a Start icon. To start a bot, the user just clicks the play icon – the UI immediately changes the status chip to green “Running…” and the backend begins execution (the SSE will soon confirm status). We use optimistic UI updates for responsiveness (show it as running instantly) but also listen for confirmation from the server (if the bot fails to start, e.g. due to config error, we revert the status and show an error banner). Pausing a bot could mean different things (perhaps leaving current orders but not placing new ones). If supported, a pause toggles the status to an amber “Paused” and disables new order placement. If a bot is paused, the user can either Resume (which essentially “start” again) or Stop completely. Stopping a bot is a heavier action – it will cancel all its orders and cease operation. On clicking stop, we prompt a confirm dialog: “Stop bot and cancel all open orders? This will withdraw any remaining funds from active orders.” If confirmed, the bot status goes red “Stopping” then “Stopped.” We highlight stopped bots in the list (greyed out or red icon) so they’re clearly not active. The user can later restart it (if logic allows restart with previous settings) or edit settings. On the Bot Detail page, similar controls exist: e.g. a prominent Start/Pause/Stop button in the header area. This redundancy ensures the operator can control the bot from either the overview list or while looking at its details.

These interactions are designed to be fast and intuitive – critical in trading scenarios. For example, One-click start/stop is inspired by exchanges like Bitfinex having one-click trading. We do include confirmations for stops to prevent accidents, but we avoid overly cumbersome flows (no multi-step process just to pause a bot – it should feel as simple as toggling a power switch). The UI also visually indicates state transitions; e.g., when clicking “Stop”, the button might turn into a loading state “Stopping…” until SSE confirms all orders cancelled and the state is indeed stopped. This real-time feedback builds trust that the command was received.

Responding to Risk Events: When a risk event occurs (say the bot triggers a stop loss or exceeds a limit and auto-stops), the UI will notify the user in multiple ways (as mentioned: banner, status chip color change, etc.). The operator’s flow for handling this is:

Notice the alert – e.g. a red banner “Bot ABC was stopped by risk management at 14:32. Click to view.” appears, and the bot’s status shows as Error/Stopped.

The user clicks the alert or navigates to the Bot Detail for that bot, where the Risk Events timeline will show what happened (with details like “Drawdown hit 20%, bot stopped”). The user can click an entry if we allow expanding for more info (maybe showing which parameter triggered).

The UI should help the user resolve or acknowledge the situation. For instance, on the Bot Detail header we might display a dismissible warning box: “Bot stopped due to risk limit. You may adjust settings and restart when ready.” In that box, provide actions: Edit Bot Settings (takes them to the builder pre-loaded with this bot’s config to perhaps widen the range or increase the loss limit) and Restart Bot (if they want to resume as is). If the user chooses to restart without changes, we likely prompt a confirmation acknowledging the risk (“Are you sure? The condition that caused the stop may still apply.”). If they edit settings, after saving, the bot can be relaunched.

Once addressed, the global alert banner can be dismissed (or auto-dismiss after user action). The bot’s risk state resets to normal if everything is resolved (and the timeline keeps a record of the event for audit).

Additionally, less severe risk warnings (not auto-stops) might simply log in the timeline and maybe flag the bot with a warning icon. The user can review and decide no action needed, in which case they might clear the warning state (we could allow marking an event as acknowledged, removing the icon). The UI encourages a proactive monitoring workflow akin to how a trading desk tool might prompt operators to intervene when limits breach. By having a dedicated timeline and explicit user actions to respond (edit, restart, etc.), we make the risk management loop clear and controlled.

Scheduling & Automation Windows: If a bot has a schedule, the UI should reflect that in its status. For example, if outside its active window, the bot might show status “Scheduled (Inactive)” – perhaps a blue or gray status indicating it’s not trading now by design. The Bot List could show a small clock icon next to such bots. When the window arrives, the bot auto-starts and the status turns green “Running”. The user can still manually start/stop outside the schedule, but we might warn if they try (like “Note: This bot is scheduled to run only during X, starting it now will override the schedule until next cycle”). In the Bot Builder, the scheduling flow ensures clarity: a visual schedule preview (maybe a timeline for the week) is shown once they set it, and the summary explicitly states next start time. If a bot is scheduled to run later (not immediately at creation), after creation we might present a info modal: “Bot created and will start at Monday 09:00 as per schedule. You can start it manually anytime.” This manages user expectation so they’re not confused not seeing immediate activity. On the Bot Detail page for a scheduled bot, if it’s currently inactive due to schedule, we show a notice like “This bot is idle until its next window at 09:00.” with an option “Start now anyway”. This level of manual override gives the operator control, reflecting real-world needs where sometimes you break the schedule if conditions change.

The schedule UI components (time pickers, day selectors) will be implemented likely using shadcn’s <Popover> and custom grid, ensuring they’re mobile-friendly and not overly complex. The concept is similar to scheduling in calendar apps but simplified for daily recurrence. This helps the platform feel like a full-featured control center, where automation can be finely tuned and isn’t just on/off.

Throughout all flows, feedback and confirmations are key. The user should never wonder “did my click do anything?” – we provide immediate UI response (button loading states, status changes) and explicit confirmations (toasts or modals) for actions taken. By mapping these flows out, we ensure the UI is not just pretty but deeply practical for an operator, minimizing the chance of user error while enabling fast interventions.

5. Visual System & Styling Guidelines

The visual design will set a tone of professional, modern, and distinct (no generic templates). Key aspects of the design system include:

Typography: Use a clean sans-serif font for the primary UI, balancing readability with density. A good choice is Inter or SF Pro Text (both highly legible and widely used in fintech apps). Headings and important values might use a slightly heavier weight or a semi-bold variant for emphasis, while body text (like table text, tooltips) stays regular weight. We will use a monospace font for numerical data in tables and charts (e.g. Roboto Mono or JetBrains Mono) to ensure alignment and a trader-terminal aesthetic for figures. The hierarchy is clear: Page titles (e.g. “Bot Detail: SOL/USDC Grid Bot”) use larger font (Tailwind text-2xl or so), section headings within pages use text-xl or lg, and labels or captions use smaller sizes. Consistent use of casing (likely Title Case for headings, Sentence case for descriptions) will be decided for clarity. All text contrasts well with background (meeting accessibility AA standards, which is important for a pro tool to avoid eye strain during extended use).

Color Palette: The default theme is a light mode with a minimal, neutral base. For example, a very light gray or off-white background (#F9FAFB or similar) for main content to reduce starkness of pure white, and a sidebar in a slightly darker neutral (#1E1E2D if we go colored, or a muted blue/gray) to provide visual anchoring. We explicitly avoid the stereotypical neon purple on black; instead, any accent color will be used sparingly to create a unique identity without overwhelming. Possible accent choices: Teal or Blue-Green (evoking Solana’s identity but toned for professionalism), or a deep blue (for that finance feel). For instance, buttons and highlights could be a teal-blue (#297B8E as an example) which stands out on light background. The palette will include:

Neutrals: various grays for backgrounds, borders, and text (e.g. dark gray #333 for main text, lighter gray #888 for secondary text, etc.).

Positive/Negative colors: Standard green for up/profit (e.g. #0FB985) and red for down/loss (#E5484D), used for PnL, price moves, or success/error states. These will be used consistently in charts (candles can be green/red, PnL line green if positive, red if negative) and in text (a profit value might be green).

Warning/Info colors: Amber or orange for warnings (risk or system alerts that aren’t critical) and blue for informational banners or links. For example, an info banner about “new update available” might be blue, a risk caution banner in orange, and a critical alert in red.

Background cards: Cards and panels will likely be white or a very light gray (to stand out from page background). The sidebar (if in light mode) could be a darker tinted version of the accent or a dark gray providing a distinct vertical band. Because we will also support dark mode, we ensure the palette has dark equivalents (e.g. dark background #121212, cards in near-black, text in light gray, accent colors slightly desaturated for dark). The design will be tested in both modes to ensure our distinct identity carries over (no generic white or generic dark – maybe our accent teal/blue becomes the common thread).

Overall, the vibe is “modern fintech”: think of the calm blues of Bloomberg or Reuters terminals combined with the crisp whites of modern SaaS – but tuned to avoid looking bland. We want a subtle sophistication; for instance, using a thin colored left border on active cards or list items to hint selection (maybe in the accent color) instead of heavy highlight bars, echoing some enterprise UI patterns.

Spacing & Layout: We will adhere to a consistent 4px or 8px grid for spacing (Tailwind’s default spacing scale). Sections will have clear separation: e.g. a margin of mb-6 (~24px) after a major section, inner card padding of p-4 (~16px) for content within. This ensures content isn’t jammed together even when data-dense. However, because trading dashboards often need to show lots of info, we will slightly compress vertical whitespace compared to say a marketing site. For instance, table rows might be a bit tighter (py-2 rather than py-4) so more rows fit on screen, but without feeling cramped. We will systematically use Tailwind classes to maintain this rhythm – a senior engineer can adjust site-wide spacing by tweaking a few Tailwind theme values if needed. Consistent use of grid and flexbox layouts will align components nicely; for example, a 12-column grid for the dashboard charts so that charts snap to known column widths. Cards will have uniform border radius (maybe rounded-md ~4px or 6px – enough to be modern, but not overly rounded), and a subtle box-shadow or border. Likely, a light border (border border-gray-200 in light mode) on cards to delineate them, switching to border-gray-700 in dark mode, with maybe a faint drop shadow for elevation where needed (popovers, modals).

Visual Hierarchy & Emphasis: We will create a clear hierarchy using color and weight. For instance, important numbers (like total PnL or current price) might be slightly larger or colored (if positive/negative). Less important data (like a table cell that is not critical) will be plain. Section backgrounds can be used to group related items: e.g. a slight tinted background for the sidebar, or even using an accent bar on the left of the sidebar to highlight the currently selected page. Icons (from a consistent set, possibly Heroicons or Lucide) will accompany text labels for quick recognition – e.g. a small robot icon for Bots, a home/portfolio icon for Dashboard, etc., in the sidebar. Within content, icons can indicate actions (edit, delete) or statuses, but we will avoid icon-overload. Every icon used will add meaning (like a shield icon next to “Risk Limit” label, to intuitively denote safety settings).

Interactive States & Animations: Subtle animations will make the app feel high-end and responsive. Examples:

Navigation: if the sidebar can collapse, it will slide smoothly. Active menu items could have a gentle color transition on hover.

Buttons: use Tailwind’s transition classes to fade background on hover, scale slightly on active press (for a tactile feel).

Chart updates: highlight flashes for updated data points as mentioned, which then fade out smoothly.

Loading states: Use skeleton screens (shadcn’s skeleton component) for charts and tables while data loads, so the user sees a placeholder outline instead of a jarring blank. This is important given real-time nature – on initial page load or if a user switches bots, we show a quick skeleton of the chart and table rather than nothing.

Modal dialogs and popovers: animate with small scale/opacity transitions (Radix UI by Shadcn provides ready-made transitions here). For example, when confirming a command, the modal could fade in and slide up slightly – giving a polished feel.

Switching themes: If the user toggles light/dark, we can animate the transition (using CSS variables or Tailwind’s transition-colors on background and text) so it fades rather than flashes.

Animation will be kept subtle – we want to avoid anything that feels gimmicky or distracts from data. The priority is responsiveness (both UI and performance). The use of SSE means frequent updates; our design ensures these updates don’t cause layout shifts (we allot fixed space for dynamically updating components) and use CSS transitions to draw attention only where needed. For example, when a new row appears in the fills table, we might slide it down into place. When an error banner appears, it could drop down from the top with a brief bounce. These touches, while small, contribute to a premium, well-crafted UX that instills confidence.

shadcn/UI Integration: The design system will leverage shadcn’s component library (built on Radix UI) for consistency. Components like Cards, Dialogs, Dropdowns, Tabs, Toasts will come styled out-of-the-box and we will customize them to our palette and spacing. This gives a unified look and feel. We’ll define a theme for shadcn that includes our font, colors, rounding, etc., so all components (e.g. a Dropdown menu for markets, or a Tooltip for data points) automatically align with the rest of the design. This approach ensures the senior engineer can implement faster (since many base styles are pre-defined) and focus on layout and data binding.

In sum, the visual system strives for clarity, consistency, and a distinct professional character. Think of it as a fusion of an institutional trading terminal and a modern SaaS dashboard: precise and data-focused (in typography and layout) but also user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing (in color, spacing, and micro-interactions). This foundation will make Zero recognizable and trusted by its users.

6. Inspiration References (UI Influences)

To validate and refine our design choices, we draw inspiration from several high-end trading and analytics platforms, borrowing proven UI elements:

Bitsgap – an all-in-one crypto trading dashboard known for unifying multiple exchange accounts and bot strategies in one interface. We take cues from Bitsgap’s unified portfolio view and bot management screens, which successfully present complex data in a single workspace. Notably, their use of panels for bots and integrated performance charts influences our Bot Detail layout. Bitsgap’s interface is intuitive despite feature richness; we emulate its balance of data density and clarity (e.g., their strategy cards and multi-exchange portfolio breakdown inspire our account dashboard).

3Commas – a popular crypto bot platform offering a wide range of bot types and analytics. 3Commas provides extensive performance metrics and breakdowns for bots. We’re inspired by how 3Commas displays bot performance (profit, trade log, etc.) and will borrow ideas like showing cumulative PnL, and providing quick actions on bot cards. Their dashboard can be overwhelming to newcomers, so our plan is to include similar depth (multi-chart analytics, rich settings) but organize it with a cleaner hierarchy to avoid overload. The analytical reports and charts in 3Commas serve as a benchmark for the kind of data our UI should eventually present (e.g., profit charts, ROI percentages), ensuring we meet “advanced user” expectations.

Pionex – a crypto exchange with built-in grid bots, known for offering many preset bots. Pionex’s interface demonstrates grid bot configuration UI done well, as it allows users to customize parameters with ease. We take inspiration from Pionex’s bot setup flow – for instance, how it might visualize the grid on the price chart and how it simplifies range inputs for beginners. Additionally, Pionex’s ability to toggle between preset strategies and manual settings gave us the idea to make our Bot Builder form possibly have template presets (though MVP might not have many templates, it’s a future consideration). The fact that Pionex’s UI is customizable by users suggests we should design flexible layouts (perhaps draggable panels in future), but initially we focus on a solid default layout.

Cryptohopper – a veteran crypto bot platform that provides both basic and advanced dashboards. We admire Cryptohopper’s “Advanced View”, which is dubbed a crypto trader’s cockpit. It likely features multiple charts and real-time data, similar to our goals. Cryptohopper emphasizes customization and a wide feature set for different skill levels, which inspires us to ensure our UI can scale in complexity without losing usability. For instance, their strategy marketplace and performance stats are something to keep in mind for future features. We particularly note how Cryptohopper might display multiple bots’ performance side by side and manage exchange connections – influencing our design of multi-bot monitoring and potential future “multi-wallet” support.

Kraken (Pro interface) – a cryptocurrency exchange interface that caters to advanced traders while maintaining an uncluttered layout. Kraken’s design shows that even with many order types and charts, careful grouping and toggling of complexity can keep the UI clean. From Kraken we borrow the concept of progressive disclosure: e.g., show basic info prominently, and hide advanced controls under expandable sections. This principle guided our decision to possibly group advanced bot settings in collapsible panels. Kraken’s color scheme (dark blues and grays) also validates our choice to go with a more conservative, professional palette rather than flashy colors.

Coinbase Pro (Coinbase Advanced Trade) – an exchange known for a clean, minimalist trading UI that doesn’t overwhelm the user. We look to Coinbase Pro for inspiration on clarity: for instance, how it uses whitespace and simple charts to make market data approachable. Our light theme and focus on core metrics on the Account Dashboard are influenced by Coinbase’s approach of only showing what’s needed for decision-making and keeping secondary info tucked away. Coinbase’s success with simplicity reinforces our mandate to avoid needless decorative elements and focus on functional design.

Zerion (DeFi Portfolio Dashboard) – a non-exchange portfolio tracker that offers a holistic view of assets with a sleek UI. Zerion’s dashboard provides an easily navigable overview of one’s entire DeFi portfolio, combining many features in a minimalistic interface. This inspires our Account Dashboard, especially the allocation breakdown and performance over time sections. Zerion manages to present complex DeFi positions in one page, which informs how we aggregate bot performances and various metrics in our design. Also, Zerion’s use of a single-page dashboard with sections for different analytics (balances, yields, etc.) influences our decision to make the account page a one-stop overview for Zero’s user, with clear segmentation of info and a modern flat design aesthetic.

FTX (Peak era interface) – a now defunct but once highly regarded crypto trading platform, noted for its speed and trader-focused design. FTX’s UI (when it was operational) excelled in real-time updates and quick actions, vital for active trading. We channel this by ensuring our UI feels snappy – SSE-driven live updates, one-click actions, and immediate feedback, much like FTX prioritized near-instant executions. The platform’s layout of orderbook, chart, and positions also teaches how to organize multiple panels without confusion. Specifically, we emulate FTX’s practice of showing real-time PnL changes and not requiring page refreshes for anything – the user should feel the system is alive and reacting instantaneously to market moves.

These references collectively guide our design to be feature-rich yet user-friendly. By borrowing the best elements – Bitsgap’s all-in-one control center, 3Commas’ depth of metrics, Pionex’s ease of configuring grid bots, Cryptohopper’s advanced cockpit, Kraken/Coinbase’s clarity, Zerion’s polished analytics, and FTX’s real-time responsiveness – we can confidently craft a UI that meets the target vision. Each element we incorporate is grounded in successful precedent, ensuring our trading bot platform feels familiar to seasoned users and impressive to new users, all while maintaining a unique “Zero” identity that stands out in professionalism and practicality.

Overall, this plan delivers a comprehensive UI/UX blueprint ready for implementation in Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn, giving the senior engineer a clear roadmap to build a premium institutional-grade trading bot dashboard. All design decisions are geared toward clarity, control, and confidence for the operator, aligning perfectly with the goals of Zero.
